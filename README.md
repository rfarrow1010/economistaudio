# Economist Audio Player

The Economist Audio Player project enables the user on desktop to listen to a downloaded
audio edition of The Economist using the command line. The point of building this project is
to have a bespoke program that handles the dozens of MP3s in the downloaded zip file and presents 
them in an easy-to-use manner. Simple keyboard inputs in the terminal enable this ease of use.
All the user has to do is download the zip file, as this requires login credentials.

Currently functional for MacOS, Linux functionality pending. No plans to build this for Windows.

# Using this package

My program uses the default OS audio player to play audio in a forked process. Feel free to fork
this repository for your own OS-dependent audio project!
